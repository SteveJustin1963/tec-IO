TEC-1

The TEC-1 was a single-board "computer" described in Talking Electronics
magazine, issues number 10 and 11. Talking Electronics do not have dates on
their issues, so the date is uncertain, although 1984 seems a reasonable
guess. Talking Electronics operated from Cheltenham, a suburb of Melbourne.

The hardware is quite simple, consisting of a Z80 cpu, 2x 8212 8-bit latch,
74C923 keyboard scanner, 20 push-button keys, 6-digit LED display, a speaker,
a 2k EPROM and sundry parts.

The cpu speed could be adjusted by using a potentiometer, the range being
250 kHz to 2MHz. This is a simple method of adjusting a game's difficulty.

Pasting:
        0-F : as is
        + (inc) : ^
        - (dec) : V
        AD : -
        GO : X

Keys:
0 to 9, A to F are on the key of the same name.
AD (input an address) is the '-' key.
+ and - (increment / decrement address) are the up and down-arrow keys.
GO (execute program at current address) is the X key.
SHIFT - later monitor versions utilised an extra shift button. Hold
        it down and press another key (use Left Shift).

Whenever a program listing mentions RESET, do a Soft Reset.

Each key causes a beep to be heard. You may need to press more than once
to get it to register.

Inbuilt games - press the following sequence of keys:
- Welcome: RESET D 1 + 0 2 AD 0 2 7 0 GO GO (Paste: D1^02 -0270XX)
- Nim: RESET AD 3 E 0 GO GO (Paste: -3E0XX)
- Invaders: RESET AD 3 2 0 GO GO (Paste: -320XX)
- Luna Lander: RESET AD 4 9 0 GO GO (Paste: -490XX)

Differences between tec1 and tecjmon:

On the tec1 a keypress is indicated by an NMI from the 74C923; but on
the jmon it sets bit 6 of port 3 low instead. The NMI code is simply
a 'retn' in the jmon rom, so we can use the same code.
The jmon includes a cassette interface, a serial input connection,
and an optional LCD, but the games of the tec1 have been removed.
